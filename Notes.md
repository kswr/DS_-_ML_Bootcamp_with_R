## 7/16 Data types

### Question posted on 7/16 lecture
a <- 5  will not assign integer to a , it will still be double (we can verify this using typeof(a) ). To assign integer one would want to use a <- as.integer(5) . To my knowledge double is default data type for numeric class, while integer is data type for integer class. Best.
